NOTE TO DEVELOPERS: TO SUPPORT DEVELOPER CUSTOMIZATION AND ENHANCEMENT OF THE ZOOMIFY VIEWER THE EDITABLE VIEWER SOURCE CODE ('.FLA' AND '.AS' FILES RATHER THAN COMPILED '.SWF' FILE) IS AVAILABLE AS PART OF ZOOMIFY'S ZOOMIFY DESIGN AND ZOOMIFY FLASH PRODUCTS.  THE ZOOMIFY LICENSE AGREEMENT ALLOWS MODIFICATION OF THESE FILES AND REDISTRIBUTION IN SWF (NON-SOURCE) FORM. 



ZOOMIFY LICENSE AGREEMENT

 

Zoomify products enable image content creators to easily author and publish high-quality images for fast, intuitive viewing over networks such as the Internet and on distributable media such as CDs and DVDs. Accordingly, the Zoomify License Agreement provides the greatest possible flexibility for Zoomify's customers.

 

ALLOWED USES

AUTHORING PROGRAMS

The Zoomify Converter is used to prepare images for zoom-and-pan viewing. The Converter is licensed per user, and may not be redistributed without a written reseller agreement with Zoomify.

The Zoomify Enterprise Converter is likewise used to prepare images for zoom-and-pan viewing, however, its functionality can be automated via scripting. This allows image conversion as part of server-side system. The Enterprise Converter is therefore licensed per server. The Enterprise Converter may not be used on more than one server without the purchase of a multi-server license or site license. The Enterprise Converter may not be redistributed without a written reseller agreement with Zoomify.

The Zoomify Converter may not be used to create an image conversion or 'zoomification' service. That is, images may be converted and distributed, however, they should not be converted solely for the purpose of distribution. Where converted for distribution, they should accompany content, software, or other added value. Individuals with a need for à la carte or on-going image conversion should acquire a license for a Zoomify product that includes the Zoomify Converter.

The Zoomifyer Enterprise Converter may be operated via command line only for internal use. You may not resell access to the Zoomifyer Enterprise Converter on a fee basis, whether a perimage fee or a time-based access fee. In other words, you may create images for your clients and customers, but you may not run an image-encoding service. If your clients or customers wish to convert images for their own use, they must purchase a license appropriate for their use.

IMAGE CONTENT

Zoomify images, the content authored and viewed with Zoomify products, is the property of the content creator and may be published, distributed, and viewed without royalty. Zoomify does not charge any fees for use of the images whether based on image volume, viewing traffic, time period, or other criteria. Zoomify images do not require any 'broadcast key' or other licensing technology.

As noted above, images should not be converted solely for the purpose of distribution as in the case of a conversion or 'zoomification' service. This is a limitation on the use of the Zoomify Converter, not a restriction on the image content of the customer.

VIEWERS

The Zoomify Viewers are used to view images that have been converted for zoom-and-pan viewing. The Viewers are used in published form as Flash movie 'SWF' files. In this form the Viewers may be redistributed on networks and distributable media. This includes the standard Zoomify Express Viewer (formerly EZ Viewer), Design Viewer, Slideshow Viewer, Gallery Viewer, Hotspot Viewer, Watermark Viewer, Comparison Viewer, Tour Viewer, Rotation Viewer, Geo Viewer, and such other viewers as Zoomify provides with the exception of the Zoomify Annotation Viewer (see below).

Viewers on distributable media must be accompanied by this License Agreement. Viewers distributed for commercial purposes must clearly include modifications and works within the scope of which the Zoomify Viewer is not the primary source of value - that is, the Viewer 'SWF' files should not be redistributed without accompanying content, software, or other added value.

The Zoomify Annotation Viewer is also used to view images that have been converted for zoom-and-pan viewing, however, its functionality depends on additional server-side data and it is typically used as part of a server-side system. The Annotation Viewer is therefore licensed per server. The Annotation Viewer may not be used on more than one server without the purchase of a multi-server license or site license. The Annotation Viewer may not be redistributed without a written reseller agreement with Zoomify.

No Zoomify Viewer shall be redistributed as part of a paid or free product with zoomable image content created by any means other than a Zoomify converter obtained with a licensed copy of a Zoomify product unless specifically permitted by a written reseller agreement with Zoomify.

SOURCE CODE

The Zoomify Viewers are created using Adobe Flash. They are used in published form as Flash movie 'SWF' files. The Viewers are authored in editable form as Flash movie 'FLA' and 'AS' source code files. Zoomify Viewer source code files and source code may not be redistributed without a written reseller agreement with Zoomify.

Zoomify products include editable source code files to enable Zoomify customers to modify the look and functionality of the Viewers as well as to allow the addition of zoom-and-pan functionality to customer Flash projects. Such use results in the creation of new publishable 'SWF' files. Such 'SWF' files may be redistributed under the following requirements:

1. The 'SWF' files must include the Zoomify copyright information, unmodified, from the original Zoomify source files. 'SWF' files on distributable media must be accompanied by this License Agreement.

2. The 'SWF' files must be created using the Publish setting 'Protect From Import' of the Adobe Flash editing software.

3. Where modifications are made to the Zoomify Viewers the modified 'SWF' files must include user-viewable information stating that the Viewers have been modified and including support contact information for the author of the modifications.

HACKING

Note that Zoomifyer EZ and Zoomify Express as well as other Zoomify products may not include Zoomify Viewer source code files. Where the source code is not provided, customization is limited to that possible with the features of the product. Specifically, Zoomifyer EZ and Zoomify Express, products typically provided by Zoomify for no charge, include splash screen logos and other branding that must not be removed. Decompilation, disassembly, or reverse engineering of Viewers provided without source code is prohibited.

The Zoomify Converter and other elements of Zoomify products are also provided without source code. Decompilation, disassembly, or reverse engineering of these products is prohibited.
